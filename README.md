# Match Game

A simple memory game I built for my toddler.

## Built With

- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- FontAwesome icons

## TODO

- [ ] shuffle cards when restarting
- [ ] leave gaps when a match was found
- [ ] add local multiplayer (turns, scores)

### NICE TO HAVE

- [ ] allow players to enter names
- [ ] generate cardData for better randomization
- [ ] allow players to set the card count
